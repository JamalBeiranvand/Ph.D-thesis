%% Introduction to Hybrid Beamforming
% This example introduces the basic concept of hybrid beamforming and shows
% how to simulate such a system.

%% Introduction
% Modern wireless communication systems use spatial multiplexing to improve
% the data throughput within the system in a scatterer rich environment. In
% order to send multiple data streams through the channel, a set of
% precoding and combining weights are derived from the channel matrix. Then
% each data stream can be independently recovered. Those weights contain
% both magnitude and phase terms and are normally applied in the digital
% domain. One example of simulating such a system can be found in the
% <docid:phased_examples.example-ex06788151> example. In the system diagram
% shown below, each antenna is connected to a unique transmit and receive
% (TR) module.
%

%
% The ever growing demand for high data rate and more user capacity
% increases the need to use the spectrum more efficiently. As a result, the
% next generation, 5G, wireless systems will use millimeter wave (mmWave)
% band to take advantage of its wider bandwidth. In addition, 5G systems
% deploy large scale antenna arrays to mitigate severe propagation loss in
% the mmWave band. However, these configurations bring their unique
% technical challenges.
%
% Compared to current wireless systems, the wavelength in the mmWave band
% is much smaller. Although this allows an array to contain more elements
% with the same physical dimension, it becomes much more expensive to
% provide one TR module for each antenna element. Hence, as a compromise, a
% TR switch is often used to supply multiple antenna elements. This is the
% same concept as the subarray configuration used in the radar community.
% One such configuration is shown in the following figure.
%
% <<../MIMOHybridBF.png>>
%
% The figure above shows that on the transmit side, the number of TR
% switches, $N_{TRF}$, is smaller than the number of antenna elements,
% $N_T$. To provide more flexibility, each antenna element can be connected
% to one or more TR modules. In addition, analog phase shifters can be
% inserted between each TR module and antenna to provide some limited
% steering capability. 
%
% The configuration on the receiver side is similar, as shown in the
% figure. The maximum number of data streams, $N_s$, that can be supported
% by this system is the smaller of $N_{TRF}$ and $N_{RRF}$.
% 
% In this configuration, it is no longer possible to apply digital weights
% on each antenna element. Instead, the digital weights can only be applied
% at each RF chain. At the element level, the signal is adjusted by analog
% phase shifters, which only changes the phase of the signal. Thus, the
% precoding or combining are actually done in two stages. Because this
% approach performs beamforming in both digital and analog domains, it is
% referred to as hybrid beamforming.
%
%% System Setup
% This section simulates a 64 x 16 MIMO hybrid beamforming system, with a
% 64-element square array with 4 RF chains on the transmitter side and a
% 16-element square array with 4 RF chains on the receiver side.

Nt = 256;
NtRF = 6;

Nr = 64;
NrRF = 6;


%%
% In this simulation, it is assumed that each antenna is connected to all
% RF chains. Thus, each antenna is connected to 4 phase shifters. Such an
% array can be modeled by partitioning the array aperture into 4 completely
% connected subarrays.

rng(4096);
c = 3e8;
fc = 28e9;
lambda = c/fc;
txarray = phased.PartitionedArray(...
    'Array',phased.URA([sqrt(Nt) sqrt(Nt)],lambda/2),...
    'SubarraySelection',ones(NtRF,Nt),'SubarraySteering','Custom');
rxarray = phased.PartitionedArray(...
    'Array',phased.URA([sqrt(Nr) sqrt(Nr)],lambda/2),...
    'SubarraySelection',ones(NrRF,Nr),'SubarraySteering','Custom');

%%
% To maximize the spectral efficiency, each RF chain can be used to send an
% independent data stream. In this case, the system can
% support up to 4 streams.

%%
% Next, assume a scattering environment with 6 scattering clusters randomly
% distributed in space. Within each cluster, there are 8 closely located
% scatterers with a angle spread of 5 degrees, for a total of 48
% scatterers. The path gain for each scatterer is obtained from a complex
% circular symmetric Gaussian distribution.

Ncl = 8;
Nray = 10;
Nscatter = Nray*Ncl;
angspread = 7.5;
% compute randomly placed scatterer clusters
txclang = [rand(1,Ncl)*120-60;rand(1,Ncl)*60-30];
rxclang = [rand(1,Ncl)*120-60;rand(1,Ncl)*60-30];
txang = zeros(2,Nscatter);
rxang = zeros(2,Nscatter);
% compute the rays within each cluster
for m = 1:Ncl
    txang(:,(m-1)*Nray+(1:Nray)) = randn(2,Nray)*sqrt(angspread)+txclang(:,m);
    rxang(:,(m-1)*Nray+(1:Nray)) = randn(2,Nray)*sqrt(angspread)+rxclang(:,m);
end

g = (randn(1,Nscatter)+1i*randn(1,Nscatter))/sqrt(Nscatter);


%%
% The channel matrix can be formed as 

txpos = getElementPosition(txarray)/lambda;
rxpos = getElementPosition(rxarray)/lambda;
H = scatteringchanmtx(txpos,rxpos,txang,rxang,g);

%% Hybrid Weights Computation
% In a spatial multiplexing system with all digital beamforming, the signal
% is modulated by a set of precoding weights, propagated through the
% channel, and recovered by a set of combining weights. Mathematically,
% this process can be described by |Y = (X*F*H+N)*W| where |X| is an
% |Ns|-column matrix whose columns are data streams, |F| is an |Ns|
% $\times$ |Nt| matrix representing the precoding weights, |W| is an |Nr|
% $\times$ |Ns| matrix representing the combining weights, |N| is an
% |Nr|-column matrix whose columns are the receiver noise at each element,
% and |Y| is an |Ns|-column matrix whose columns are recovered data
% streams. Since the goal of the system is to achieve better spectral
% efficiency, obtaining the precoding and combining weights can be
% considered as an optimization problem where the optimal precoding and
% combining weights make the product of |F*H*W'| a diagonal matrix so each
% data stream can be recovered independently.
%
% In a hybrid beamforming system, the signal flow is similar. Both the
% precoding weights and the combining weights are combinations of baseband
% digital weights and RF band analog weights. The baseband digital weights
% convert the incoming data streams to input signals at each RF chain and
% the analog weights then convert the signal at each RF chain to the signal
% radiated or collected at each antenna element. Note that the analog
% weights can only contain phase shifts.
% 
% Mathematically, it can be written as |F=Fbb*Frf| and |W=Wbb*Wrf|, where
% |Fbb| is an |Ns| $\times$ |NtRF| matrix, |Frf| an |NtRF| $\times$ |Nt|
% matrix, |Wbb| an |NrRF| $\times$ |Ns| matrix, and |Wrf| an |Nr| $\times$
% |NrRF| matrix. Since both |Frf| and |Wrf| can only be used to modify the
% signal phase, there are extra constraints in the optimization process to
% identify the optimal precoding and combining weights. Ideally, the
% resulting combination of |Fbb*Frf| and |Wrf*Wbb| are close approximations
% of |F| and |W| that are obtained without those constraints.
%
% Unfortunately, optimizing all four matrix variables simultaneously is
% quite difficult. Therefore, many algorithms are proposed to arrive at
% suboptimal weights with a reasonable computational load. This example
% uses the approach proposed in [1] which decouples the optimizations for
% the precoding and combining weights. It first uses the orthogonal
% matching pursuit algorithm to derive the precoding weights. Once the
% precoding weights are computed, the result is then used to obtain the
% corresponding combining weights.
%
% Assuming the channel is known, the unconstrained optimal precoding
% weights can be obtained by diagonalizing the channel matrix and
% extracting the first |NtRF| dominating modes. The transmit beam pattern
% can be plotted as.

F = diagbfweights(H);
F = F(1:NtRF,:);
pattern(txarray,fc,-90:90,-90:90,'Type','efield',...
    'ElementWeights',F','PropagationSpeed',c);

%%
% The response pattern above shows that even in a multipath environment,
% there are limited number of dominant directions.
%
% The hybrid weights, on the other hand, can be computed as

At = steervec(txpos,txang);
Ar = steervec(rxpos,rxang);

Ns = NtRF;
[Fbb,Frf] = helperOMPHybridPrecodingWeights(H,NtRF,Ns,At);

%%
% The beam pattern of the hybrid weights is shown below

pattern(txarray,fc,-90:90,-90:90,'Type','efield',...
    'ElementWeights',Frf'*Fbb','PropagationSpeed',c);
%%
% Compared to the beam pattern obtained using the optimal weights, the
% beam pattern using the hybrid weights is similar, especially for dominant
% beams. This means that the data streams can be successfully transmitted
% through those beams using hybrid weights.

%% Spectral Efficiency Comparison
% One of the system level performance metrics of a 5G system is the
% spectral efficiency. The next section compares the spectral efficiency
% achieved using the optimal weights with that of the proposed hybrid
% beamforming weights. The simulation assumes 1 or 2 data streams as
% outlined in [1]. The transmit antenna array is assumed to be at a base
% station, with a focused beamwidth of 60 degrees in azimuth and 20 degrees
% in elevation. The signal can arrive at the receive array from any
% direction. The resulting spectral efficiency curve is obtained from 50
% Monte-Carlo trials for each SNR.

% beamforming can perform close to what optimal weights can offer using
% less hardware.
